# ATO Library

Purpose: store standards/specs referenced by queue items and link them to actionable work.

- `baseline-support.json` lists Baseline evidence sources and their queue IDs.
- Add documents or excerpts under `.ato/library/` and link them from the queue item details.
- Keep entries deterministic (no timestamps) and prefer stable IDs.
